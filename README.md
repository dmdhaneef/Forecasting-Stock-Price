## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast stock prices based on past trends, using:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (scaling, windowing)
- LSTM-based model training
- Evaluation and visualization of predictions
- Deployment using Streamlit
